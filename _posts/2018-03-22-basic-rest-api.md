To install an express application, run the following in a new directory by 
```
$ npm install express-generator -g
```

Running the generator, a basic application can be generated by:
```
$ express --view=pug myapp
```

for further build options run:
```
$ express -h
```

To run the application, cd to the location and use:
```
$ npm start
```
CRUD:
1. Creation - post
2. Read - get
3. Update - put
4. Delete - delete

However, http protocols do not directly translate, as post may be used to also read - post can be used for creation and reading but data or a data set does not need to be returned. For example, validating a user login does not need to return any data other than that the login attempt is either successful or if it has failed.
Basic express application can be made in the ```routes``` folder, by doing the follows:

```javascript
router.get('/get', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})
```

Queries can be defined as follows:
```javascript
app.get('/login?username=testuser&password=testpass', function (req, res) {
  res.send(`a request for the user: ${req.query.username} and password: ${req.query.password} has been made`)
})
```
This allows you to pass a query in the uri as such ```localhost:8080//login?username=<USER>&pass=<PASS>```

Parameters can be defined as follows:
```javascript
app.get('/book/:bookid', function (req, res) {
  res.send(`a request for book ${req.params.bookid} has been made`)
})
```
Any value passed after ```book/``` will be passed to req.params.bookid, for example ```localhost:8080//book/29```, req.params.bookid will be equivalent to 29
