Every developer has a list of bookmarks links that they have for reference - so here's a list of mine that I use when I'm developing my front end projects.

* [Freecodecamp](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-roadmap-to-becoming-a-web-developer-in-2017-b6ac3dddd0cf) - useful for knowing what to start to look at in your area of expertise
* [Tutorials point react](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/reactjs/reactjs_state.htm) - a quick reference to react that has different documentation to the official react documentation, for times you need another example
* [Questions to ask clients](http://blog.web123partners.com.au/blog/the-10-questions-you-must-ask-your-client-before-designing-their-website.aspx) - what you should be asking your clients before you go ahead
* [Fast link to sass](http://sass-lang.com/libsass) - because we all need some sass in our lives
* [Flexbox cheat sheet](http://vudav.github.io/flexbox-cheatsheet/) and [css-tricks flex](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - because I don't have space in my brain to remember all the flex properties despite how much I use them
* [Lorem ipsum picture equivalent](https://picsum.photos/) - there's plenty out there, but this is the one I use
* [Coolhue](https://webkul.github.io/coolhue/), [flat ui](https://flatuicolors.com/), [material colours](http://materialuicolors.co/?ref=flatuicolors.com),

* [Specificity hacks](https://csswizardry.com/2014/07/hacks-for-dealing-with-specificity/)
* [You might not need jquery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/) - if you're still using jquery, maybe you should adapt and move on
