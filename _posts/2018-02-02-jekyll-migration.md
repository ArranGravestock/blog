I've always wanted to use Jekyll, I've heard about how useful it can be without having to use a blogging host such as Wordpress or Square space. I didn't want to bloat the blog, and spend days modifying it and learning how to use Wordpress. It's not something I ever really want to learn - the future is now old man (Wordpress is the old man). I don't know why I never really moved over to Jekyll as soon as I heard about it - it's a lot simpler than I originally thought it'd be. It took me a few hours, mostly because I'm now working on my Windows partition and Jekyll isn't as friendly with windows as it is with Linux distros.

If you are looking for a blogging tool, Jekyll is definitely something you have to try out of your options. Most people who host on Wordpress always find themselves waiting for a page to load or it crashes or even in worst case scenarios becoming infected with malware. You also can pretty much host all of this free combined with Github pages, the only thing I pay for is the domain - and with emerging developers using a github page, you really don't have to.

I thought of changing my original website to generate posts in a static fashion similar to Jekyll - but it's an unnecessary process really, it's like re-inventing the wheel but you create a hexagon instead. It works but it isn't the wheel. It's not hard to do either, but it's just a commitment to a half-arsed project that requires daddy's time over more important things.

On a last note, this means more blog posts to come in a regular fashion. I'm starting to sound like an outro of a BroScience video now.
