If you aren't releasing regularly, you're probably causing frustration in all aspects of the business not just your development team.

Maybe you understand the value of why your development team should be releasing reguarly, but if you don't the list below outlines some of the values.
1. Your codebase is regularly kept up to date, you'll have less conflicts in merges,
2. Each team individual will see their work used, and feel much better about it,
3. Live testing is valuable for team development, the more you break stuff, the more you'll learn from it and improve your process.

Those are just a few values, but what about other people?

### Team
Your team are incredibly impressed by your release schedule, they can sell new features, blag about how often the product is updated which really helps close sales. Your support/customer relations team can also report back to customers who provided feedback, and your customers feel like they've been listened to. Score!

### Customers
Having a good release schedule can really make a change on customer perspective of the company; they'll see your features & bug fixes more often, they know you're actively working on the product and listening to feedback when it comes to bugs.

### Competitors
Competitors you say? Why do they benefit? They don't, but you make them look worse. If they're not regularly releasing then you have the one up on them, your customers will be getting the features faster and you'll be laughing straight to the bank.

So why aren't you releasing every week now?
